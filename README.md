Final Project for Group 3 of CEN 3721

Zodiac Love Calculator 


1. Forming a group:
   - 
  * Group 3 consists of Michaela Dunston, Gabriella Castellon, Nikohl Fuentes, and Rachel Oliveira
    
  * Communication channel: We have instant messaging through our phones and we will share our Python and group project files through GitHub.


2. Defining the topic:
   -
  * The design topic our group is aiming for is making a **Zodiac Love Calculator **, where we can make the application have interactable widgets, and use API's that will determine the compatibility of the user's zodiac with other zodiacs or inputs.
    
  * Our interests in pop culture and astrology helped us brainstorm this idea, and we intend this application to be used within a young teen - young adult demographic.
    
  * This idea is highly feasible because it has been recreated in a variety of ways and with other factors in consideration such as age, occupation, hobbies, academic majors, etc.

  * Our project's outline is featured in the "HCIFinalProject.py" file, and its deadline is December 3rd, 2023.

5. Setting up the development environment:
   -
  * Set up a new project in PyCharm or use an existing Python project. Make sure libraries, or tools required for working with the chosen API are properly installed.
  
  * Recommended: Set up a shared version control system (e.g., Git) for collaborative coding and project tracking.
